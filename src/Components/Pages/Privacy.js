Introduction and contents

This is the privacy policy for CAPRI Media (“Capri”, “we”, “us”), our sites such as caprimag.com (“our sites”), and our associated apps.

We think carefully about our use of personal data, and below you can find the details of what we do to protect your privacy. This policy covers, among other topics:

Information about your rights, the choices available to you, and our obligations in the European Union, in California, in Australia, and elsewhere

About this privacy policy

This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, share, and transfer your personal data when you use the services provided on our sites and our apps or interact with us; and your data privacy rights.

Personal data is any information about you by which you can be identified or be identifiable. This can include information such as:

your name and email address

information about your device (such as the IP address, which is a numerical code to identify your device that can provide information about the country, region or city where you are based)

information relating to how you use and interact with our sites, apps and services

When we refer to “personal data” in this policy, we are also referencing “personal information,” as it is defined under California law and as it is defined under Australian law, which you can read about here.

Who we are

Capri Mag is the data controller in respect of your personal data. This means that we are responsible for deciding how and why we hold and use your personal data.

your IP address - a numerical code to identify your device, together with the country, region or city where you are based

your geolocation data - your IP address can be used to find information about the latitude, longitude, altitude of your device, its direction of travel, your GPS data and data about connection with local Wi-Fi equipment

your browsing history of the content you have visited on our sites, including how you were referred to our sites via other websites

We will not collect special categories of data from you - such as personal data concerning your race, political opinions, religion, health or sexual orientation - unless you have chosen to provide that type of personal data to us.

How we collect personal data

We collect personal data when you:

sign up for our editorial emails

sign up for marketing communications

use mobile devices to access our content

access and interact with any of our sites and app

through cookies and other similar technology

when you contact us via email, social media, our apps or similar technologies or when you mention us on social media

How we use your personal data

We use personal data collected through our sites and apps only when we have a valid reason and the legal grounds to do so. We determine the legal grounds based on the purposes for which we have collected your personal data.

Legal grounds for using your personal data

The legal ground may be one of the following:

Consent: Often we will use your personal data because we have asked for your consent, which you can withdraw at any time. Examples of where we ask for your consent include:

to send marketing emails to you, when we have asked your permission. You can withdraw your consent to receiving these emails at any time by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of the email.

to place non-essential cookies, or other similar technology. We provide more details of how we use cookies in our cookie policy. You can withdraw your consent by declining our use of cookies.

Performance of a contract with you (or in order to take steps prior to entering into a contract with you): We will use your personal data if we need to in order to perform a contract with you. For example, where you have purchased a subscription from us, we will need to use your contact details and payment data in order to process your order and deliver your subscription.

Compliance with law: In some cases, we may have a legal obligation to use or keep your personal data.

Our legitimate interests: We may process your personal data where it is necessary for our legitimate interests in a way that might be expected as part of running Capri and in a way which does not materially impact your rights and freedoms. For example it is in our legitimate interests for us to understand our readers, promote our services and operate our sites and apps efficiently for the creation, publication and distribution of publications and fashion content both online and in print form, globally. Examples of when we rely on our legitimate interests to use your personal data include:

when we analyse what content has been viewed on our sites and apps, so that we can understand how they are used and improve our content.

for internal administrative purposes related to our services - such as our accounting and records.

to inform you of any changes to our services, such as updates to our terms and conditions.

to personalise our services by remembering your settings, and recognising you when you return to caprimag.com.

contacting you directly via social media or email if you send us emails or contact us.

when we respond to your queries and to resolve complaints.

to collect and log IP addresses to improve and manage our site and apps.

for security and fraud prevention, and to ensure that our sites and apps are safe and secure.

Where we rely on cookies to collect any personal data please see our cookie policy for more information and how to manage your cookie choices through your Privacy settings.

Capri is a media organisation and publisher. Data protection law includes certain exemptions when personal data is processed for the purposes of journalism. Those exemptions apply to some of the ways Capri uses personal data. This Privacy Policy does not cover personal data that Capri processes for the purposes of journalism.

Using children’s personal data

We do not aim any of our products or services directly at children under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect personal data about children under 13. Some of our services may have a higher age restriction and this will be shown at the point of registration. We also note that California law prohibits sale of personal data of consumers between 13-16 years of age unless the guardian has authorised the sale. We comply with this requirement.

Security of your personal data

We have implemented appropriate technical and organisational controls to protect your personal data against unauthorised processing and against accidental loss, damage or destruction. Unfortunately, sending any information, including personal data, via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data once with us, we cannot guarantee the security of any personal data sent to our site while still in transit and so you provide it at your own risk.

When we share or sell your personal data

Depending on where you live, we may share your personal data in order to perform a contract with you, for administrative purposes, or when we have a legitimate interest in doing so. For example:

If you are going to one of our events hosted by an event partner, we may share your personal data with that partner for event administration purposes

Sometimes we may receive a letter, email or another form of communication from you that we consider to be significant to the history of Capri. We may decide to share this with our archive for historic and archiving purposes

We may share your data to understand how you interact across our group products or to tailor and offer relevant advertising to you.

Agencies and authorities if required by law - We may reveal your personal data to any law enforcement agency, court, regulator, government authority, or in connection with any legal action if we are required to do so to meet a legal or regulatory obligation, where the request is proportionate, or otherwise to protect our rights or the rights of anyone else (for example, in response to valid and properly served legal process such as subpoena or warrant). If we have your contact details, we will take reasonable steps to attempt to notify you prior to disclosing your data unless (i) prohibited by applicable law from doing so, or (ii) there are clear indications of unlawful conduct in connection with your use of Capri Mag services.

Event sponsors and partners - we may share your personal data with sponsors of Capri events and partners who we hold events with for marketing purposes when you have given your permission for us to do so.

International data transfers

Data we collect may be transferred to, stored and processed in any country or territory where Capri or one or more of our service providers are based or have facilities. While other countries or territories may not have the same standards of data protection as those in your home country, we will continue to protect personal data that we transfer in line with this privacy policy.

Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the US, we ensure similar protection and put in place at least one of these safeguards:

We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been found to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data.

We may also use specific approved contracts that use Standard Contractual Clauses for the protection of personal data where appropriate, with our service providers that are based in countries outside the US, providing your personal data the same protection it has in the US.

How long we keep your personal data

We keep your personal data for only as long as we need to. How long we need your personal data depends on what we are using it for, as set out in this privacy policy. For example, we may need to use it to answer your queries about a product or service and as a result may keep personal data while you are still using our product or services. We may also need to keep your personal data for accounting purposes, for example, where you have bought a subscription. If we no longer need your data, we will delete it or make it anonymous by removing all details that identify you. If we have asked for your permission to process your personal data and we have no other lawful grounds to continue with that processing, and you withdraw your permission, we will delete your personal data. However, when you unsubscribe from marketing communications, we will keep your email address to ensure that we do not send you any marketing in future.

How we may contact you

Service communications

From time to time we may send you service emails, for example, telling you your subscription is coming to an end or thanking you when you contribute or place an order with us.

Marketing communications and editorial newsletters

If we have your permission or you have not opted out, we may send you materials as part of our monthly publication.

You can decide not to receive these emails at any time and will be able to “unsubscribe” directly by clicking a link in the email.

Responding to your queries or complaints

If you have raised a query or a complaint with us, we may contact you to answer your query or to resolve your complaint.

Cookies and similar technologies

When you visit our sites or when you use our apps, we may collect personal data from you automatically using cookies or similar technologies.

This privacy policy includes our cookie policy, where you can find more information about our use of cookies.

Your privacy and data protection rights with regard to the personal data that we hold about you

You have a number of rights with regard to the personal data that we hold about you and you can contact us with regard to the following rights in relation to your personal data:

You have the right to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you

You have the right to correct the personal data we hold about you

Where applicable, you may also have a right to receive a machine-readable copy of your personal data

You also have the right to ask us to delete your personal data or restrict how it is used. There may be exceptions to the right to erasure for specific legal reasons which, if applicable, we will set out for you in response to your request

Where applicable, you have the right to object to processing of your personal data for certain purposes

Where you have provided us with consent to use your personal data, you can withdraw this at any time

If you would like to exercise any of your rights specified above, please email admin@caprimag.com. We will deal with requests within one month.

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity. If your request is complicated or if you have made a large number of requests, it may take us longer. We will let you know if we need longer than one month to respond. You will not have to pay a fee to obtain a copy of your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.

We and our partners use cookies and similar technologies to collect information about your use of the website to help create reports and statistics on the performance of the website. Analytics cookies such as Google Analytics collect information such as your IP address, device type and operating system, referring URLs, location and pages visited. If you don’t want Google Analytics to be used in your browser, you can install the ‘Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-On’, provided by Google.
